# Introduction

`Homotopy.Continuation.jl` is a package for solving systems of polynomials with
only finitely many solutions using numerical homotopy continuation.
If this is your first time reading this documentation, we recommend you start with the
[getting started guide](http://www.JuliaHomotopyContinuation.org/guides/getting-started).
