# Introduction

[`Homotopy.Continuation.jl`](https://www.JuliaHomotopyContinuation.org) is a package for solving systems of polynomials equations with
only finitely many solutions using numerical homotopy continuation.
If this is your first time reading this documentation, we recommend you start with the
[getting started guide](https://www.JuliaHomotopyContinuation.org/guides/latest/get-started).
