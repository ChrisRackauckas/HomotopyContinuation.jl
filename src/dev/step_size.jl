    AbstractStepSize

Abstract type representing the configuration for the step length logic of a path tracker.
This always deals with a normalized parameter space, i.e., ``t âˆˆ [0, 1]``.

"""
    AbstractStepSizeState

Abstract type representing the state of a `AbstractStepSize` implementation.

Initialize the state for the given step length type.

Reset the state to the initial state again.

"""
    isrelative(::AbstractStepSize)

Indicate whether the returned step length is relative or absolute, i.e.,
if we want to track from `1` to `5`. A relative step length of `0.1` would result
in an effective step length of `0.4` while an absolute step length of `0.1` would result
in an effective step length of `0.1`.

    initial_steplength(::AbstractStepSize)

Return the initial step length of a path.

"""
    update(curr_steplength, step::AbstractStepSize, state::AbstractStepSizeState, success::Bool)

Returns the new step length. `success` indicates whether the step was successfull. This
modifies `state` if necessary.

The step length is defined as follows. Initially the step length is `initial`.
If `consecutive_successes_necessary` consecutive steps were sucessfull the step length
is increased by the factor `increase_factor`. If a step fails, i.e. the corrector does
not converge, the steplength is reduced by the factor `decrease_factor`.
